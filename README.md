# Express Blog Editor
This is the front-end private editor page of my **REST API blog project** built using React and Tailwind CSS for me to try my hand at full-stack web development.

The other components of this project are a **back-end API server** at [Express Blog](https://github.com/chew01/express-blog) built using Express JS and Mongoose, as well as a **public-facing blog** at [Express Blog Frontend](https://github.com/chew01/express-blog-frontend) built using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Framework considerations
The editor is much more bare-bones than the blog as it was only meant to be accessible to admins (namely, myself).

It was to contain a **log-in page**, as well as:
- A draft composer (which could save drafts, instantly publish a post, or update an existing post)
- Post/User/Comment manager to perform CRUD operations on

## Website design considerations
Similar to the public blog, the editor was also built from a **Mobile First** perspective using the Tailwind V3 CSS framework.
